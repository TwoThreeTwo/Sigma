# Sigma Grindset

- so, I found this on GitLab and I thought this was funny lol. (https://gitlab.com/Arithmo/Sigma incase you weirdos want to clown me for not crediting)
- I did the funny, are you proud of me mom!

# Note
- This isn't fully decomp, I don't have the time nor the knowledge of just doing that stuff.
    - (BEWARE BITCOIN MINER!!!!!!!!!!)
    - Ok so, I don't think this is real but just a re-creation thingy. I still think it's the funny.



# Weird stuff
- So, I was scrolling through and I saw in util there's a security section with HWID stuff, and then there's 
a java class called Crypto, it's just some cipher thingy not sure what it really is, but you can skid it if you want lol.
